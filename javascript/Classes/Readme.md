Classes :
     In js, classes are a way to define blueprints for creating objects.


Key Concepts :

1) Class Declaration:
     You declare a class using the class keyword.
     Inside a class, you define properties (variables) and methods (functions) that will belong to the objects created from this class.

2) Constructor:
     A special method inside the class that is called when you create an instance (an object) of the class.
     Itâ€™s used to initialize the properties of the object.

3) Methods:
     Functions that are defined inside the class and can be used by all instances of the class.

4) Inheritance:
     Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing you to create a new class based on an existing one.

5) Static Methods:
     Methods that belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class. You call them directly on the class.

6) Getters and Setters:
     Special methods that allow you to define how properties are accessed and modified.
